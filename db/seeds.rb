# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# 1750.times do |n|
#   name = Faker::Name.name
#   email = Faker::Internet.email
#   zipcode = Faker::Address.zip_code
#   state = Faker::Address.state
#   employees = Faker::Number.between(1, 650)
#   city = Faker::Address.city

#   Customer.create!(
#     name: name, 
#     email: email,
#     zipcode: zipcode,
#     state: state,
#     employees: employees,
#     city: city)
# end

# # bundle exec rake db:seed
